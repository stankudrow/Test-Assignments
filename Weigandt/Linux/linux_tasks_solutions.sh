## S1, Task 1. How to see if the environment variable ORACLE_HOME is set up and what value it has?

# Note!
# I have no ORACLE_HOME in environment and I didn't write it in .profile or /etc/environment files.
# That is why it is exported here for demonstration purpose
export ORACLE_HOME="Oracle Home Variable"; echo -e "S1T1: $(printenv | grep 'ORACLE_HOME')\n"


## S1, Task2. Set up environment variable TEST_VAR with value "test"

export TEST_HOME="test"; echo -e "S1T2: $(printenv | grep 'TEST_HOME')\n"


## S1, Task3. Name console tools in Linux which could be used for monitoring.

printf "S1T3 -> Some monitoring commands:\n"

printf "top htop iohtop and its variances to monitor statistics on real-time processes.\n"

printf "vmstat - memory statistics (-s)\n"

# 3. Print all ".cfg" files 
# 4. Show last 25 lines of file "./example/test.log"
# 5. Show the first 25 lines of file "./example/test.log"

# Directory "./example/" contains a big amount of files of different types and sub-directories with files of different types.
# 1. Find all files in the directory "./example/" (and all sub-directories) which contains text "test_mark". Print only filenames
# 2. Find all files in directory "./example/" (and all sub-directories) ending with ".log", which were modified in the last 2 days and have size >10 MB
# 3. You have file "./example/test.log" which have size > 3GB. What is the fastest way to clean the file content without deleting and recreating the file.
# 4. Find all files in directory "./example/" (and all sub-directories) ending with ".log", which are older than 30 days, zip them with the replacement of source files.
